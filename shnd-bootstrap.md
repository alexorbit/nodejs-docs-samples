# SHND Bootstrap

## [\#]()1. First make sure you've downloaded and have the GUI Wallet App from StrongHands Website: [https://www.stronghands.info/](https://www.stronghands.info/)

* If this is the first time you're using a wallet app, then open the wallet app and let it run for about ten seconds. Then close the wallet app and make sure it's not running. This will create the SHND Folder for you if this is the first time you're using a wallet app.
* If this is not the first time you're using a wallet app, then first open your wallet app and backup and keep a saved copy of your wallet. Then close your wallet app and make sure it's not running.

## [\#]()2. Download the BootStrap from the link that's provided above in our website.

* It also can be found [here in our SHND Repository](https://github.com/stronghands-official/assets/releases/download/shnd-bootstrap-0.7.3.0/SHND-Bootstrap-ver0.7.3.0.zip/)

## [\#]()3. Locate your SHND Folder and delete everything that's in the SHND Folder except for this file: wallet.dat

* If you don't know how to find your SHND Folder, then here's instructions below for WINDOWS OS, MAC OS, and LINUX/UBUNTU OS:

3. Then type this: %appdata%\SHND
4. Then press Enter.
5. This will take you directly into your SHND Folder.

### [\#]()Here's how to find your SHND Folder for MAC OS:

2. Then type this: ~/Library/Application Support/SHND
3. Then press Enter.
4. This will take you directly into your SHND Folder.

### [\#]()Here's how to find your SHND Folder for LINUX/UBUNTU OS:

## [\#]()6. Now open your wallet app and let it fully sync.

## [\#]()7. When your wallet app is fully synced, also check if your wallet app's blocks are up-to-date with the [Explorer Website](https://www.coinexplorer.net/SHND)

## [\#]()8. This step is only for those who've used a SHND GUI Wallet app before in the past.

* If this is the first time you've ever used a shnd wallet app, then you don't have to follow this step and you're finished.

### [\#]()So for those who've used a SHND Wallet App before in the past, continue from here:

1. On your wallet app; click Help, then click Debug window, then click the Console tab.
2. Then type this: repairwallet
3. Then press Enter.
4. After you press Enter,

* If the results say "mismatched coins", then simply close your wallet app and restart it again.
* If the results say "True", then there's nothing else to be done.
